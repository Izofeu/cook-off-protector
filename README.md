# Cook Off Protector
## An anti-griefing PAYDAY2 mod created to combat trolls on meth cooking heists.
It features three modes of operation:
* Autokick players on ingredient pickup (Default)
* Disallow players from picking up cooking ingredients and transfer them to the host
* Warn in chat about picking up an ingredient

When a player joins your lobby, they will be greeted by the following message:
> This lobby is running a Cook Off Protector mod - picking up meth ingredients is punishable! Autokick is ENABLED.

Installation is as simple as extracting it into your mods folder. Make sure you have SuperBLT installed!

This mod **doesn't affect Lab Rats!** It only works on heists where cooking ingredients are Mission Equipment.

Contributions are welcome!
